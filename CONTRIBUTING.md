# Contributing to Varlord

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Varlord!

## Development Setup

### Quick Start

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   make dev-install
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

That's it! You're ready to contribute.

For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## Development Workflow

### Standard Development

For active development where you need to import and use varlord:

```bash
make dev-install  # Installs package + all dependencies
make test         # Run tests
make lint         # Check code quality
make format       # Format code
```

### CI/CD or Code Review

If you only need development tools (linting, formatting) without installing the package:

```bash
make setup-venv   # Only installs dependencies, not the package
make lint         # Can still run linting
make format-check # Can still check formatting
```

**Note**: Some tests may require the package to be installed.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

3. **Run checks**:
   ```bash
   make check  # Runs lint, format-check, and tests
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**

## Code Quality

- **Linting**: `make lint` (uses flake8)
- **Formatting**: `make format` (uses black)
- **Type checking**: `mypy` (optional, not enforced in CI)
- **Tests**: `make test` (uses pytest)

All checks must pass before submitting a PR.

## Testing

### Run all tests:
```bash
make test
```

### Run with coverage:
```bash
make test-cov
```

### Run integration tests (requires external services):
```bash
make test-integration
```

### Run etcd tests (requires etcd server):
```bash
make test-etcd  # Includes connection test and all integration tests
```

### Run dotenv tests (requires python-dotenv):
```bash
make test-dotenv
```

## Documentation

### Build documentation:
```bash
make docs
```

Documentation is built using Sphinx. See `docs/` directory for source files.
